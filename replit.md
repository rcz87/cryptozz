## System Architecture
The system architecture is streamlined and focused on core functionalities, prioritizing an API-driven interaction over a traditional GUI.

### UI/UX Decisions
Signal notifications are formatted professionally with HTML markup, proper number formatting, and clear displays for comprehensive technical indicators and AI market analysis. Dynamic emoji indicators are used to convey confidence levels of alerts.

### Technical Implementations
